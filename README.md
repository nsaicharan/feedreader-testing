# Feed Reader

## About

This project is a part of Google Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.

In this project I've been given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developers of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite. My job was to finish writing tests for the given functionality of the app.

## Tests

1. RSS Feeds - Tests that feeds are loaded and name/url of each feed is defined.
2. The Menu - Tests that menu is hidden by default and the visibility is toggled when menu icon is clicked.
3. Initial Entries - Tests to ensure that initial feed entries are loaded properly.
4. New Feed Selection - Tests to ensure that content changes when a new feed is loaded.
